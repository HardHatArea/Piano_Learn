Program to visualize and think about modes in the diatonic major scale.
-When ran a set of keys 2 octaves apart will appear
-In the title bar you will see a prompt(i.e What is the second of the dorian mode in the key of A)
---The dorian mode in the key of A starts on B.  The second of the dorian mode is then C#
---Clicking on C# will print the note name and clicking again will move onto the next question
---Clicking outside of the region will not do anything until C# is clicked
---Only the left octave is clickable
